                    The Job has three main target groups; the first one being growth startups based in the above-mentioned countries, who are facing various challenges related to scalability. These challenges can be related to recruitment, funding or other insights. As a startup, you might be looking to expand your team in order to build or scale, looking for funding, or being in the need of best practice tools such as a pitch deck or employment contract. The Hub has gathered the solutions to those challenges and more importantly made them accessible. <br />   <br />
                    The second main target group is applicants who want to join a startup. It is those who are already a part of the startup ecosystem, students with the dream of becoming entrepreneurs, employees in larger organisations, or anyone else wanting to be part of a startup journey. <br />    <br />
                    The third target group is investors interested in growth startups in the Nordics. It is those who are looking to invest in the next big unicorn e.g. venture capital funds, angels, accelerators and incubators. The Hub has assembled these and given them visibility towards growth startups who are looking for funding. The Hub is completely free to use for all three groups; startups, applicants and investors. <br />  <br />
