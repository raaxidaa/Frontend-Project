        <h4>Hiring Without Discriminating
        – Do's and Don’ts</h4>
        <p>From the moment a job applicant reaches out to you regarding a potential job post, he or she is protected by the Swedish Discrimination Act and the EU Directive for Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation. As an employer, you have to be mindful of this and not let any of the discriminatory grounds be the reason you deny someone an interview or a job.</p>
